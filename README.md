## Career Objectives

I am pursuing a new career in software development. I discovered after 5 years of teacher that my real passion lies in helping others problem solve. While teaching gave me some satisfaction in this, I didnâ€™t feel as though the logic-oriented side of my brain was being challenged enough. This is what led me to the Java/Android DeepDive Coding Bootcamp and my interest in becoming a software developer. 

##Technical Toolbox:

Programming Languages	:Java, SQL
Markup and Style Languages:	XML, HTML, Markdown, CSS
Frameworks & Libraries:	Java & Android standard libraries, JavaFX, Room, Hibernate, Spring & Spring Boot       
Development Environment & Tools:	IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, Git
Operating Systems:	Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android
Collaboration Platforms:	GitHub, Google Suite (Docs, Sheets, Mail, Drive, Presentation, Calendar)
Applications:	Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel)



## Current Projects

* [A-Maze-Ballz](https://github.com/edubois9119/a-maze-ballz) 
  *	Created a maze game app that requires the user to navigate a ball through a randomly generated maze, by tilting the device or - optionally - using the touch screen. Selecting higher levels of difficulty results in the generation of increasingly complex mazes.


* [Dominion App](https://dominion-game.github.io/)
  * Created a mobile version of the board game Dominion, a deck-building game for 2+ players. The Dominion app seeks to recreate the game experience by using a visual interface imitating the physical setup of the card game and uses Android, Android Room, Spring, Spring Boot and Hibernate technologies
