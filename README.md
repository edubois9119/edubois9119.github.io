# Welcome

## Career Objectives

I am pursuing a new career in software development. I discovered after 5 years of teacher that my real passion lies in helping others problem solve. While teaching gave me some satisfaction in this, I didnâ€™t feel as though the logic-oriented side of my brain was being challenged enough. This is what led me to the Java/Android DeepDive Coding Bootcamp and my interest in becoming a software developer.
