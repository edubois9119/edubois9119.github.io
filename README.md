## Career Objectives

I am a Software Developer with a background in Spring, Java, and Android software development. In my current role I am creating new microservices and updating and customizing current applications. I am a hard-worker, a quick-learner and I enjoy helping others while making a difference in our world. I am enjoying every minute of software development and can't wait to see what's next! 

## Technical Toolbox:
* Programming Languages
   * Java, SQL
* Markup and Style Languages
   * XML, HTML, Markdown, CSS
* Frameworks & Libraries
   * Spring & Spring Boot, Java & Android standard libraries, JavaFX, Room, Hibernate

## Current Hobbies

* [A-Maze-Ballz](https://github.com/edubois9119/a-maze-ballz) 
  *	Created a maze game app that requires the user to navigate a ball through a randomly generated maze, by tilting the device or - optionally - using the touch screen. Selecting higher levels of difficulty results in the generation of increasingly complex mazes.


* [Dominion App](https://dominion-game.github.io/)
  * Created a mobile version of the board game Dominion, a deck-building game for 2+ players. The Dominion app seeks to recreate the game experience by using a visual interface imitating the physical setup of the card game and uses Android, Android Room, Spring, Spring Boot and Hibernate technologies
