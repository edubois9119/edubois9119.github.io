## Career Objectives

I am a Software Developer with a background in Java and Android software development. I went from knowing very little about software development to creating an Android maze game application and working on team to create a mobile version of the game Dominion. I am a hard-worker, a quick-learner and I enjoy helping others while making a difference in our world. I am enjoying every minute of software development and can't wait to see what's next! 

## Technical Toolbox:
* Programming Languages
   * Java, SQL
* Markup and Style Languages
   * XML, HTML, Markdown, CSS
* Frameworks & Libraries
   * Java & Android standard libraries, JavaFX, Room, Hibernate, Spring & Spring Boot       
* Development Environment & Tools
   * IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, Git
* Operating Systems
   * Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android
* Collaboration Platforms
   * GitHub, Google Suite (Docs, Sheets, Mail, Drive, Presentation, Calendar)
* Applications

## Current Projects

* [A-Maze-Ballz](https://github.com/edubois9119/a-maze-ballz) 
  *	Created a maze game app that requires the user to navigate a ball through a randomly generated maze, by tilting the device or - optionally - using the touch screen. Selecting higher levels of difficulty results in the generation of increasingly complex mazes.


* [Dominion App](https://dominion-game.github.io/)
  * Created a mobile version of the board game Dominion, a deck-building game for 2+ players. The Dominion app seeks to recreate the game experience by using a visual interface imitating the physical setup of the card game and uses Android, Android Room, Spring, Spring Boot and Hibernate technologies
